# Go Get Started
A Go project containing several components to bootstrap your new Go adventure.

## Project Layout 
See [golang-standards/project-layout](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout) for best practices for setting
up your project.

## Go Modules
Run `go mod init` to create a standard go.mod file for your current project.

See [Go Modules](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/go#hdr-Module_maintenance) for more details.

## Makefile
Add a Makefile to make life easier. ;-)

## Go Coverage
To create a test coverage run `make cover`.
It will run the tests with coverage measuring and then will open a browser showing the results.
