# Go Get Started
A Go project containing several components to bootstrap your new Go adventure.

## Go Modules
Run `go mod init` to create a standard go.mod file for your current project.

See [Go Modules](Ihttps://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Module_maintenance) for more details.

## Makefile
Add a Makefile to make life easier. ;-)

## Go Metalinter
See [here](https://github.com/alecthomas/gometalinter) for more instructions.

Basically run `curl -L https://git.io/vp6lP | sh` from GOPATH directory to install the metalinter.

## Go Coverage
To create a test coverage run `make cover`.
It will run the tests with coverage measuring and then will open a browser showing the results.
